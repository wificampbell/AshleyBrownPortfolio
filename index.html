    <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
  
    <p class = "home"> Hello, my name is Ashley and I have a deep passion for coding that sparked a little during my middle school years. My coding journey truly began in computer class, where we had the opportunity to explore various websites. My favorite one was  <a class = "link" href = "https://scratch.mit.edu"> <b>Scratch</b></a>, a website where you can create your own games using a drag-and-drop method/block method. During that time, I created 3-4 games, although they remain incomplete. Even so, this experience marked the beginning of everything. However, it was in 10th grade when my passion exploded, and I found my true love in coding and designing video games.</p>
  
    <p class = "home">In 10th grade, I was playing a game called <a class = "link" href = "https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/"> <b>Genshin Impact</b>. </a> Genshin Impact is an open-world action game developed by miHoYo in which you complete quests, roll for new characters, and can play with friends, among other features. While playing, I was astonished by the game's graphics. The crystal-clear water, the unexpected changes in weather, and the fight scenes were all breathtaking. Additionally, I was impressed by the character designs and movements, and I thought to myself, 'I want to make a game like this.' And so, my journey began. I started looking up coding tutorials, taught myself some C++, and added coding classes to my school schedule, among other things.</p>
