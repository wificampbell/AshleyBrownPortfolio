      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Ashley Brown, and I am a first year at Marist <s>College</s> University. I am currently
        studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design and Programming and a minor in Games and Emerging
        Media. </p>
      <h2>Why Coding?</h2>

      <p> Simply because I love games, and I love coding. Coding for games was first introduced to me during middle.
        During Computer Class, we had the opportunity to explore various websites, with one of those websites being <a
          class="link" href="https://scratch.mit.edu"> <b>Scratch</b></a>, a website where you can create your own games
        using a drag-and-drop method/block method. <br><br>10th grade is when my passion exploded, and I found my true
        love in coding and designing video games. Through playing a multitude of games, I started to become intrigued by
        what was happening behind the scenes. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 50px;"><i>"I started to wonder what went into making the game so majestic. How do the trees
          move? Does each leaf move on its own, or do they move in groups? How do the enemies know where they can and
          cannot walk? With questions circulating my mind, I became more intrigued with video games as a whole. Instead
          of just playing video games, I began mentally breaking them down..." </i></p>
