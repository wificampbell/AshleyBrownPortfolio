      <a id=link href="https://sou76y.csb.app"> Build A Better Planet</a>

      <p>Created during a 3-day-long code-a-thon, this website was developed with the goal of providing a solution to
        help end pollution. Using Google's Machine Learning, our website is able to detect whether an item can be
        recycled or not.</p>

      <a id=link href="https://wificampbell.github.io/PersonalityQuiz/"> Danganronpa Personality Test</a>

      <p>I created this personality website where you answer a few questions, and at the end, it tells you which
        character from the show Danganronpa you are. This website was a good way for me to experiment with variables and
        JavaScript.</p>

      <a id=link href="https://wificampbell.github.io/ActivistToolkit/"> My Activist Toolkit</a>

      <p>With this advocacy website, I used my coding skills to raise awareness of a global issue: child abuse. Not only
        that, but I also added resources that people can call or go to if they need help.</p>

      <a id=link href=" https://wificampbell.github.io/First-Website/"> My First Website</a>

      <p>This Get-To-Know-Me website was my very first website. Although I could have done better with the color choices
        and design, this website is important to me because it showcases my interests, favorite artists, some of my
        favorite drawings, a few poems that I have written, and one intriguing aspect of my future goals.</p>
